          <p>
            My name is Montrelle Hines, Monti for short. I'm a Virginia native.
            I've lived here most of my life but have had the opportunity to
            travel to many destinations. From my mother's side of the family, I
            have latin american/carribean heritage from the Dominican Republic.
            I'm quite daring and impulsive. I'm up for anything that seems like fun
            or a thrill to me, but I have my boundaries, of course. I've dabbled
            in a variety of career fields, from retail to teaching English as a foreign
            language. I'd describe myself as a creature of the night because I'm
            generally awake at strange hours of the night, living the Nocturnal
            life lol. I have so many diverse hobbies and interests that I am
            well rounded in many areas, a jack of all trades, master of none.
